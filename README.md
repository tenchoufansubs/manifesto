# Manifesto

These repositories are meant to make it easier to keep the subtitles
up to date once they are released.

If any mistake is found, these files will be updated as soon as possible.

The subtitles for any series will not be made public before the
actual release. There will be always a blog post before any new file is
pushed here.

Regardless of who is pushing to these repositories, Tenchou Fansubs is
a team, and every member contributes in some way to make the releases
possible.
